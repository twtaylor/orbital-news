# Orbital News Testing Strategy

This document outlines the testing strategy for the Orbital News client application, focusing on end-to-end testing with Playwright.

## Overview

The Orbital News application presents unique testing challenges due to its 3D visualization using Three.js. Our testing approach addresses:

1. UI interactions and functionality
2. 3D orbital system behavior
3. Performance considerations
4. Visual rendering across browsers
5. API integration

## Test Structure

Tests are organized into the following categories:

### End-to-End Tests
- `app.spec.ts`: Basic application functionality
- `orbital-system.spec.ts`: Camera controls and orbital system interactions
- `article-interaction.spec.ts`: Article search and refresh functionality
- `pause-functionality.spec.ts`: Testing the pause/resume feature
- `api-mocking.spec.ts`: Testing with mocked API responses

### Visual Tests
- `visual.spec.ts`: Tests for visual appearance and 3D orbital characteristics

### Performance Tests
- `performance.spec.ts`: FPS monitoring and orbital system configuration verification

## Test Data

Mock data for testing is stored in:
- `fixtures/mock-articles.json`: Sample article data for API mocking

## Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
pnpm test

# Run tests with UI
pnpm test:ui

# Debug tests
pnpm test:debug

# View test reports
pnpm test:report
```

## Testing Considerations

### 3D Visualization Testing
- Camera rotation and zoom functionality
- Proper orbital characteristics (distances, 3D orbits, elliptical paths)
- Pause/resume functionality

### User Preferences
Tests verify the orbital system adheres to user preferences:
- Articles orbit at specific distances (10, 20, 30 units)
- True 3D orbits with y-axis variation (±30° from ecliptic)
- Elliptical orbits
- Appropriate gravitational constants

### Performance Testing
- FPS monitoring during interactions
- Configuration verification

### Visual Testing
- Screenshots from multiple angles to verify 3D characteristics
- Baseline comparisons for UI elements

## Future Enhancements

1. **Visual Regression Testing**: Implement pixel-by-pixel comparison with baseline images
2. **Accessibility Testing**: Add tests for keyboard navigation and screen reader compatibility
3. **Load Testing**: Measure performance with large numbers of articles
4. **Mobile Device Testing**: Add specific tests for mobile interactions
5. **Cross-Browser Testing**: Expand test coverage across more browsers

## Test Environment

Tests run in the following browsers by default:
- Chromium
- Firefox
- WebKit (Safari)

## Screenshots

Test screenshots are saved to the `tests/screenshots` directory for manual review and future automated visual comparison.
